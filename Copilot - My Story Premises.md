<div>Here are all the suggestions I (Copilot) have given you so far:</div>

<ul>
<li><b>Mysterious Signal</b>: Scientists on Earth detect a highly unusual signal coming from the outer edge of the Milky Way. The signal contains patterns that suggest an advanced civilization, but it's unlike anything humanity has encountered before. This discovery sets off a race to decode the signal and uncover its source.</li>

<li><b>Unexpected Anomaly</b>: Astronomers observe a sudden and inexplicable change in the behavior of a distant star system. The star's light dims and brightens in a way that defies known astrophysical phenomena. This anomaly prompts an urgent mission to investigate and understand the cause.</li>

<li><b>Ancient Artifact</b>: A deep-space exploration team discovers an ancient artifact floating in the void between star systems. The artifact contains advanced technology and hints at a long-lost civilization that once thrived in the galaxy. The team must unravel the artifact's secrets and its connection to the galaxy's history.</li>

<li><b>Galactic Event</b>: A rare and catastrophic event occurs at the center of the galaxy, sending shockwaves throughout the Milky Way. This event disrupts the stability of star systems and poses a threat to all life in the galaxy. Scientists and explorers must work together to understand the event and find a way to mitigate its effects.</li>

<li><b>Disappearing Stars</b>: Multiple stars across the galaxy begin to mysteriously disappear, leaving behind only empty space. This phenomenon baffles scientists and raises fears of an unknown cosmic threat. A team is assembled to investigate the cause and prevent further disappearances.</li>

<li><b>Stellar Nursery</b>: A newly discovered region on the galaxy's edge is found to be a stellar nursery, where new stars and planets are forming at an accelerated rate. Among the new planets, one shows signs of an ancient, advanced civilization that may hold the key to understanding the galaxy's future.</li>

<li><b>Cosmic Artifact</b>: An ancient artifact is discovered floating in the void between star systems. It contains advanced technology and a message from a long-lost civilization, warning of a cosmic event that could threaten the entire galaxy.</li>

<li><b>Galactic Whisper</b>: Scientists detect a faint, repeating signal from the center of the galaxy. It's not just any signal—it's a message in an ancient, long-forgotten language. The discovery suggests the existence of an advanced civilization that predates humanity and holds secrets about the galaxy's origins.</li>

<li><b>Temporal Rift</b>: A sudden rift in space-time appears on the outskirts of the galaxy, emitting strange energy readings. Explorers who venture near it experience glimpses of the past and future, hinting at a cosmic event that could alter the fate of the galaxy.</li>

<li><b>Vanishing Planets</b>: Entire planets begin to disappear without a trace, leaving behind only empty space. The phenomenon baffles scientists and raises fears of an unknown cosmic threat. A team is assembled to investigate the cause and prevent further disappearances.</li>
